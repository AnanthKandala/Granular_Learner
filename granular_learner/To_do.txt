Code to write:
[done]    - Initialize spheres inside the rectangle:
        - Create a grid and randomly select points to place the spheres.

[done]    - Calculate the energy of the system: 
        - Obtain pairwise "shortest" distances and compute the bulk and boundary interaction energies

    - Optimizer:
        - Starting from some initialization, use scipy minimize to obtain the stable configuration of the particles.
          particle positions are bounded to be inside the 
          ** I dont understand how the optimzation algorithm knows about the periodic conditions. The energy function is periodic.
             Is this enough?
        - Which is the best optimizer? What aout pre-conditioning?

    - Callbacks for the Optimizer:
        - Record positions, total energy, bulk energy, boundary energy though the process of optimization
        - Record the metric used for convergence and optimization 
    
[done]    - plotter:
        - plot the state of the system: 
            - boundary rectangle
            - boundary spheres
            - interior spheres, differentiate the radii and sphere index
            - dotted spheres to show periodicity in the y direction.
